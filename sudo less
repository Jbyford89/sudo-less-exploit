# If a users permissions in the `/etc/sudoers` file is configured incorrectly, this allows the specific user `sudo` access
# this allows the user the ability to gain root access.

# To test this on your own system first it is recommended that you copy a file such as `/etc/passwd` and save it to a desired location such as 
`~/Documents/<new-file.txt>`

# To do this run the command
 `cp /etc/passwd <new-file.txt>` # Replace <new-file.txt> with the name you choose

# Run this command from whatever directory you would like to save the file to
# To specify the save location you can use the absolute path like `admin@ubuntu:/$ cp /etc/passwd ~/Documents/my_file.txt`

#ie:
`admin@ubuntu:~$ cp /etc/passwd my_file.txt` 
# copies `/etc/passwd` and saves it to the home directory `~`. This is the current directory
`admin@ubuntu:~$ pwd`
`/home/admin`
